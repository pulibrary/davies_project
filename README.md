# Davies Project Website

The core asset from the [original website](https://daviesproject.princeton.edu/) is the database compiled from punch cards produced by Professor Haynes McMullen in his research on American Libraries before 1876.  The contents of that database were converted to CSV, as were some metadata: a key to the library types in the data table, a glossary of those types, and a bibliography.

This repository contains code to publish this data as a Jekyll site, using templates from CollectionBuilder.
