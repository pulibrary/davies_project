## Data Table
Data from McMullen's punch cards was extracted into a table at
Princeton University.  The table below may be sorted by column and
searched using simple keywords.

Use the "Excel" and "CSV" buttons below to download the filtered
metadata you see on the page.  Alternatively, the site's [source code
is available on GitHub](https://github.com/pulibrary/davies_project).
