<p class="card-text">This database covers institutional and
                                    commercial libraries that existed in what is now the continental
                                    United States from the time of first settlement through 1875. It
                                    records nearly 10,000 libraries.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The end-date of 1876 is important because in
                                    that year the United State Bureau of Education published its
                                    first comprehensive, national listing of libraries, entitled
                                        <i>Public Libraries in the United States of America: Their
                                        History, Condition, and Management. Special Report. Part.
                                        1</i> (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1876).
                                    This massive work &mdash; 1187 pages &mdash; of facts and
                                    statistics began a continuous series of such like publications
                                    stretching down to the present. See the website of the National
                                    Commission on Libraries and Information Science for the series's
                                        <a href="http://www.nclis.gov/statsurv/NCES/edpubs.html"
                                        >list</a>. The database 'American Libraries Before 1876'
                                    extends this series of facts and statistics back to the first
                                    colonial libraries.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Most of the libraries before 1876 were very
                                    small, a few hundred books at the most; and most had a very
                                    short active life. Most libraries were membership organizations,
                                    which served the members who provided financing. Even small
                                    communities often had more than one library, each of which
                                    served residents of a particular geographical area; and in
                                    cities there also were often several libraries, each of which
                                    served different segments of the population.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The small size of the libraries and their short
                                    lifespan means that little information is available about most
                                    of them. Indeed, the record of the existence of many stems from
                                    an almost passing mention or a brief listing. Many more surely
                                    existed, but that likelihood by no means takes away from the
                                    utility of this database. In almost all cases the patterns that
                                    it reveals will continue to stand.</p>
