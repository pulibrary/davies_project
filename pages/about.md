## About the Davies Project
The Davies Project was an effort to increase knowledge about American
university libraries and their collections, begun by Princeton
University President emeritus and Professor of Economics and Public
Affairs Harold T. Shapiro and Stephen Ferguson, Curator of Rare Books
at the Princeton University Library in 2000.

The project's major digital accomplishment was a database compiled from the
punch cards used by Professor Haynes McMullen in his decades-long
research into American Libraries before 1876.  The contents of this
database are now being made available for searching and browsing.


The Davies Project also compiled an extensive bibliography and a
collection of transcriptions, as well as a collection documenting the
history of the Princeton University Library.  These may be browsed [here](http://libweb2.princeton.edu/rbsc2/libraryhistory/main.html).
