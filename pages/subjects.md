## Library Types
<p><i>Academy Library.</i> Almost always the library of a secondary school, so
  not included in the main part of this study unless it was a library of a military
  academy that gave college-level work. See the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">headings</st1:PlaceName>
  <st1:PlaceType w:st="on"><i>School</i></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><i> library
  </i>and <i>Military academy library.</i></p>
<p><i>Agricultural and mechanical college library. </i>The library of a college
  that emphasized agriculture and engineering. In this study, these colleges have
  been considered as agricultural colleges.</p>
<p><i>Agricultural library belonging to a state government. </i>A few state boards
  of agriculture had libraries, beginning in the 1850s.</p>
<p><i>Agricultural social library.</i> A library belonging to a group that was
  organized to establish a library about agriculture.</p>
<p><i>Agricultural society library. </i>A library owned by a society formed because
  its members were interested in agriculture. Some of these were called <i>Farmers'
  clubs</i>.</p>
<p><i>Antiquarian library. </i>In this study, such a library is considered as
  a <i>Historical society library.</i></p>
<p><i>Apprentices' library. </i>A library for the use of apprentices, usually
  planned and supervised by older businessmen or employees and usually containing
  a general collection of books. Often open to others besides apprentices. Similar
  to a <i>Mechanics library </i>or a <i>Workingmen's library</i> but counted separately
  in this study. </p>
<p><i>Art museum library. </i>A small number of these existed, mainly after the
  Civil War. In this study, such a library has been considered as an <i>Art Society
  library.</i></p>
<p><i>Art Society library. </i>A library belonging to a society formed because
  of its members' interest in art. A very few of these existed, mainly after the
  Civil War. In this study, art museum libraries are included with them.</p>
<p><i>Association library. </i>See <i>Society library.</i></p>
<p><i>Asylum library. </i>The term <i>asylum </i>was widely used for any institution
  where handicapped or disadvantaged children or adults lived and were cared for.
  Many were maintained by charitable societies; others were operated by federal,
  state or local governments.</p>
<p><i>Athenuem library </i>(formerly spelled <i>athenaeum</i>). Athenuems were
  societies, partly social and partly cultural. Their libraries were like social
  libraries because both kinds were general and because the operation of a library
  was one of the main objects of the athenaeum. If the athenaeum library differed,
  it was because it might put more emphasis on current journals and newspapers.</p>
<p><i>Bar association library. </i>A library belonging to a group of lawyers whose
  association was not formed for the primary purpose of maintaining a library.
  See also <i>Social law library.</i></p>
<p><i>Board of trade library. </i>A library owned by an association of merchants
  whose main purpose was the regulation of trade or promotion of commerce. In
  this study, libraries of similar organizations known as <i>Merchants' exchanges</i>
  and <i>Chambers of commerce</i> are included with board of trade libraries.</p>
<p><i>Book club library. </i>Members of some book clubs exchanged the books they
  read. If there is evidence that they collected a library, it is included with
  <i>Literary society libraries</i> and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on"><i>Reading</i></st1:place></st1:City><i> club libraries</i>.</p>
<p><i>Bray libraries. </i>The libraries sent from <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
  to Church of England parishes, mostly in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Maryland</st1:place></st1:State>
  beginning around 1700 through the efforts of Thomas Bray, have been considered
  in this study as <i>Church libraries.</i></p>
<p><i>Business college library. </i>Some schools for instruction of business skills
  owned libraries beginning in the 1840s. These libraries have been included in
  the study although it is possible that their institutions did not offer work
  at the college level.</p>
<p><i>Chamber of commerce library. </i>A few such libraries existed; in this study,
  they are grouped with <i>Boards of trade libraries</i> and <i>Merchants' exchanges
  libraries.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Church library. </i>A library maintained by a particular church in a particular
  town or city. In this study, the term is considered as separate from a <i>Sunday
  school library </i>and from any library owned by a group of churches or by some
  other religious association, which is considered as a <i>Religious society library.</i></p>
<p><i>Circulating library. </i>Originally, any library from which books could
  be taken home. The term was used to designate two main types: a <i>Commercial
  circulating library</i>, operated for profit, and a <i>Social library</i>, operated
  for the benefit of users. In recent years, historians have usually limited the
  term to mean what is called in this study a <i>Commercial circulating library.</i></p>
<p><i>Club library. </i>The term <i>club </i>began to be common in the 1850s to
  denote a society, usually with a social rather than a subject interest. In this
  study, a library belonging to such an organization has been considered as a
  <i>Society library.</i></p>
<p><i>College library. </i>A library belonging to an institution of higher education.
  In this study, the term <i>college </i>alone means liberal arts college; a more
  specialized college is distinguished as <i>Medical college</i>,<i> Law school</i>,
  a<i> Theological seminary</i>, or by any other appropriate phrase.<i> </i></p>
<p><i>College literary society library. </i><st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">See</st1:PlaceName>
  <st1:PlaceType w:st="on"><i>College</i></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><i> student
  society library.</i></p>
<p><i>College student society library. </i>A library belonging to a society of
  students in an institution of higher education. These societies, often called
  literary societies, held meetings for social and educational purposes and typically
  owned general collections of books. A few suck societies, mainly in theological
  seminaries, had libraries containing books on religion. Collections on other
  special subjects were rare.</p>
<p><i>Commercial circulating library. </i>A library owned by an individual or
  firm and containing books that were circulated to individuals for a fee. The
  fee was usually in the form of a subscription, payable monthly, quarterly or
  annually. The collections were almost always general and popular in nature.</p>
<p><i>Commercial college library. </i>See <i>Business college library.</i></p>
<p><i>Convent library. </i>A few convent libraries were discovered, apparently
  controlled by Roman Catholic organizations; they are counted as <i>Church libraries</i>
  in this study.</p>
<p><i>County law library. </i>This kind of library seems to have usually been
  the library owned by the county bar association. Therefore, in this study, such
  a library is considered as one belonging to a <i>Bar association</i> unless
  information indicates that it was not.<i> </i></p>
<p><i>County library. </i>This term had no generally accepted meaning, and was
  rare outside of <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Indiana</st1:place></st1:State>, where a county
  library was a social library that has been established with funds from a special
  tax. In this study, it has been as a <i>Government-aided social library.</i></p>
<p><i>Court library. </i>Many local, state and federal courts had libraries. In
  this study, libraries belonging to each of these three forms of government are
  combined with other legal collections and are considered as <i>Law libraries.</i></p>
<p><i>Dentistry library. </i>A small number of dental libraries existed. In this
  study, they have been included with <i>Medical libraries.</i></p>
<p><i>Education library. </i>A few state governments operated libraries that were
  on the subject of education or were intended for educational professionals,
  beginning in the 1850s. The libraries operated by a few city boards of education
  at about the same time may have had an educational emphasis, but several of
  them were clearly general in content.</p>
<p><i>Elementary school library. </i>A library in a school containing only the
  lower grades. These libraries were not included in the main part of this study<b>.</b>
</p>
<p><i>Engineering college library. </i>See <i>Scientific</i> <i>or engineering
  college library.</i></p>
<p><i>Engineering society library. </i>A small number of civil and mining engineers'
  societies had libraries, beginning in the 1850s. See <i>Scientific or engineering
  society library.</i></p>
<p><i>Farmers' club library. </i>See <i>Agricultural society library.</i></p>
<p><i>Federal government library. </i>See <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><i>United
  States</i></st1:place></st1:country-region><i> government library.</i></p>

  existed mainly in larger cities and were general in content.</p>
<p><i>Foreign language library. </i>A library collected by a group of people speaking
  a language other than English. Almost all of them were operated by German immigrant
  groups; see <i>German social library</i>,<i> German society library</i>,<i>
  </i>and <i>Musical society library.</i></p>
<p><i>Fraternal organization library. </i>A library belonging to a lodge of the
  Masons, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, or other fraternal group. In this
  study, a library belonging to a German-speaking fraternal group is considered
  as a <i>German society library</i>, and the small number of Masonic college
  libraries is included with other <i>College libraries.</i></p>
<p><i>Garrison library. </i>A library at a military post, usually general in nature.</p>
<p><i>German social library.</i> A term used in this study to include any library
  formed by German-speaking people if it was like other social libraries in organization.<i></i></p>
<p><i>German society library. </i>A term used in this study to include any library
  belonging to a society of German-speaking people if the society was formed for
  some purpose other than the maintenance of a library. However, collections belonging
  to German singing societies have been grouped with those of other <i>Musical
  society libraries.</i></p>
<p><i>Government library. </i>Many of the libraries in this study were operated
  by federal, state or local units of government. See such headings as <i>Agricultural
  library belonging to a state government</i>, <i>County library</i>, <i>Court
  library</i>, <i>Public library</i>, <i>School district library</i>, <i>State
  library</i>, <i>Territorial library</i>, and <i>Township library.</i></p>
<p><i>Government-aided social library. </i>A <i>Social library </i>with some support
  from a unit of government. A few existed in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Indiana</st1:place></st1:State> (see <i>County library</i>), <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Massachusetts</st1:place></st1:State>,
  and elsewhere.</p>
<p><i>Health, state board library. </i>A few state boards of health had libraries
  after the Civil War. </p>
<p><i>High school library.</i> A library in a school containing the upper grades,
  of less than college level. Libraries in elementary and secondary schools are
  not included in the main part of this study.</p>
<p><i>Historical social library. </i>A library belonging to a society whose main
  purpose was to form a library on historical subjects. Very few of these existed.</p>
<p><i>Historical society library. </i>A library belonging to a society formed
  because of the members' interest in history.</p>
<p><i>Horticultural society library. </i>In this study, such a library is considered
  as an <i>Agricultural society library.</i></p>
<p><i>Hospital library. </i>A library in a hospital, whether intended for the
  patients or the medical staff. In this study, the patients' libraries are considered
  separately from the medical libraries because of the difference in subject matter.
  A library in a mental hospital is considered an <i>Asylum library.</i></p>
<p><i>Hotel reading room. </i>Hotels sometimes maintained reading rooms containing
  a few books, current journals, and newspapers. In this study, such a room is
  included as a <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on"><i>Reading</i></st1:place></st1:City><i> room in a commercial enterprise.</i></p>
<p><i>House of refuge library. </i>A library in a home for unfortunate persons:

  in this study.</p>
<p><i>   </i></p>
<p><i>I.O.O.F. library. </i>A library belonging to a lodge of the Independent
  Order of Odd Fellows. See <i>Fraternal organization library.</i></p>
<p><i>Industrial school for boys' library. </i>It is not always clear whether
  such a library belonged to a reformatory or to some other kind of school. If
  it seemed to belong to a reform school, it is included in the main part of this
  study as a <i>Prison library</i>, but if it seemed to belong to another kind
  of school, it is not included in the main study. Only a few libraries in industrial
  schools were discovered.<i><u> </u></i></p>
<p><i>Insane asylum library. </i>See <i>Asylum library.</i></p>
<p><i>Institute library. </i>The word <i>institute </i>alone does not help to
  identify the type of library because some institutes were schools, some were
  societies, and some were charitable enterprises. The word seems to imply only
  that the agency was in some way educational, charitable or cultural.</p>
<p><i>Juvenile society library. </i>A library for children, organized by children
  or their elders. A few such libraries existed, mainly in <st1:place w:st="on">New
  England</st1:place> after about 1790.</p>
<p><i>Ladies' library. </i>See <i>Ladies' social library </i>and <i>Ladies' society
  library.</i></p>
<p><i>Ladies' social library. </i>A library formed by women and intended for their
  use. It was established by an association that was organized in order to maintain
  the library. These collections were general in content and existed mainly in
  <st1:place
w:st="on">New England</st1:place> and the state of <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Michigan</st1:place></st1:State>.</p>
<p><i>Ladies' society library. </i>A library belonging to a women's society that
  did not have the maintenance of a library as its main purpose. Collections belonging
  to women's sewing clubs and literary societies are included here.</p>
<p><i>Land grant college library. </i>See <i>Agricultural and mechanical college
  library.</i></p>
<p><i>Law library. </i>There were several kinds of libraries containing mainly
  or entirely law books. See <i>Bar association library, County law library, Law
  school library, State law library, </i>and <i>State library.</i></p>
<p><i>Law school library. </i>The library of a law school has been included in
  the study if the school was independent or if its library was reported as separate
  from that of the college or university with which the school was connected.</p>
<p><i>Library association. </i>The same as a <i>Library society.</i></p>
<p><i>Library society. </i>If preceded by a place name, this phrase ordinarily
  meant a <i>Social library.</i></p>
<p><i>Literary society library. </i>A library belonging to a society made up of
  persons interested in literature. However, because that term was often used
  broadly, the collection could have been general in subject matter.</p>
<p><i>Lyceum library. </i>A lyceum was an organization made up of people who met
  together to debate and to listen to lectures and who usually established a general
  library. If there is evidence that a lyceum had a library, it is included in
  this study. If a lyceum's main emphasis was its library, its purpose was almost
  the same as that of a <i>Social library.</i></p>
<p><i>Lyceum of natural history library. </i>This term occurred occasionally;
  in this study, it is considered as a <i>Scientific or engineering society library.</i></p>
<p><i>Maclure library. </i>The name sometimes given to <i>Workingmen's library
  </i>established with the help of funds provided in William Maclure's will.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Manufacturers' library. </i>A term that was used to mean a library maintained
  in a factory by its owner, for the use of employees, who were sometimes called
  <i>manufacturers</i>. Such a library was more often called a <i>Mill library.</i></p>
<p><i>Masonic college library. </i>A few liberal arts colleges were supported
  by the Masons. In this study, their libraries have been included with those
  of other college libraries.<i> </i></p>
<p><i>Masonic library. </i>A library operated by and for a lodge of Masons. See
  <i>Fraternal organization library.</i></p>
<p><i>Mechanics' library. </i>A library for artisans. These libraries usually
  contained general collections and were similar to <i>Apprentices' libraries
  </i>and <i>Workingmen's libraries.</i></p>
<p><i>Mechanics' society library. </i>A phrase occasionally used; in this study,
  considered as a <i>Mechanics' library.</i></p>
<p><i>Medical college library. </i>A library belonging to a school that trained
  physicians.</p>
<p><i>Medical social library. </i>A library belonging to a society whose main
  purpose was to form a library of medical books. Very few of these existed.</p>
<p><i>Medical society library. </i>A library owned by a society of physicians
  whose main purpose was not to maintain a library.</p>
<p><i>Mental hospital library. </i>A few libraries seem to have existed in institutions
  for the mentally ill, which were hospitals rather than asylums. However, the
  number was so small and the distinction so vague that each of them has been
  included in this study as an <i>Asylum library.</i></p>
<p><i>Mercantile library. </i>A library formed for the use of clerks in business
  firms. Ordinarily formed by the clerks themselves and ordinarily general in
  content.</p>
<p><i>Merchants' exchange library. </i>See <i>Board of trade library.</i></p>
<p><i>Military academy library. </i>The library belonging to a secondary school
  or college in which the main emphasis was on military topics. If the academy
  seems to have been of college grade, its library is included in this study as
  a <i>Military college library.</i></p>
<p><i>Military college library. </i>The library belonging to a school of college
  grade in which the main emphasis was on military topics. There seems to have
  been a very small number of such libraries.</p>
<p><i>Military post library. </i>See <i>Garrison library. </i></p>
<p><i>Military social library. </i>A term used in this study for <i>Social library
  </i>formed by military personnel. Only rarely was a military library clearly
  of this type; if its ownership and operation is doubtful, it has been considered
  as a <i>Garrison library.</i></p>
<p><i>Mill library. </i>A library maintained in a factory by its owner, for the
  use of employees. Sometimes a small fee was charged. Such a library was more
  often found in <st1:place
w:st="on">New England</st1:place> than elsewhere.</p>
<p><i>Mining library. </i>A very few libraries were on the subject of mining.
  In this study, they have been included with <i>Scientific or Engineering libraries.</i></p>
<p><st1:place w:st="on"><i>Mission</i></st1:place><i> library. </i>In this study,
  any library belonging to a Catholic missions has been considered as a <i>Church
  library. </i>Most of these libraries were in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">California</st1:place></st1:State>.</p>
<p><i>Missionary society library. </i>A few libraries belonging to (mostly Protestant)
  missionary societies were discovered. Each of them is included in this study
  as a <i>Religious society library.</i></p>
<p><i>Musical society library. </i>A library belonging to a society formed because
  of its members' interest in music. Several of these were established by German-speaking
  persons.</p>
<p><i>Officers' library. </i>If a library used by military officers was clearly
  owned and operated by a group of officers who formed a library society, it is
  considered in this study as a <i>Military social library.</i> Otherwise, it
  is considered as a <i>Garrison library.</i></p>
<p><i>Orphanage library. </i>See <i>Asylum library.</i></p>
<p><i>Patients' library in a hospital. </i>In this study, such a library has been
  considered as separate from a medical library in a hospital. <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">See</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on"><i>Hospital</i></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><i>
  library.</i></p>
<p><i>Penitentiary library. </i>See <i>Prison library.</i></p>
<p><i>Pharmacy library. </i>In this study, the very few pharmacy libraries have
  been considered as <i>Medical libraries.</i></p>
<p><i>Polytechnic institute library. </i>In this study, each of these libraries
  has been considered as a <i>Scientific or engineering college library.</i></p>
<p><i>Post library. </i>A library at a military post. See <i>Garrison library.</i></p>
<p><i>Prison library. </i>A library for the use of prison inmates. In this study,
  reform school libraries are included with prison libraries.</p>
<p><i>Proprietary library. </i>A term that was never in general use in the nineteenth
  century. It was used interchangeably with the term <i>Subscription library </i>by
  Edward Edwards in his book <i>Memoir of Libraries, </i>published in 1859. Apparently,
  the two terms were both used to describe social libraries until 1912 when Charles
  K. Bolton published a pamphlet, <i>Proprietary and Subscription Libraries,</i>
  and began to employ the term <i>Proprietary library </i>if the users of the
  collection owned stock in it; he employed the term <i>Subscription library</i>
  for one in which the users paid annual fees. Writers since his day have accepted
  his idea, apparently ignorant of the fact that, for many social libraries, the
  proprietors were called subscribers and paid an annual fee. They sometimes permitted
  others to use the collection for a fee. The term <i>Proprietary library </i>is
  not used in the present study.</p>
<p><i>Public library. </i>Before 1876, this term was ordinarily used to mean any
  library other than one owned by an individual for his or her own use. In that
  sense, it would include every library in the main part of this study. But in
  this study it is used in its more recent sense to mean a library, usually general
  in content, which was almost always owned by a local government and was open
  to most or all of the citizens without charge. No distinction is made as to
  means of financial support: whether by taxation or through the gifts of individuals.
  Also see <i>Religious library belonging to a town.</i></p>
<p><i>Public library owned by a religious group. </i>A few libraries were owned
  by churched or religious societies and were clearly open to the public without
  charge. Because of the difficulty of determining the exact content and conditions
  of use of libraries owned by churched and other religious groups, each of these
  free libraries has been considered in this study as either a <i>Church library</i>
  or a <i>Religious society library, </i>depending on its ownership. <i> </i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Public library owned by an individual. </i>A very few libraries owned by
  individuals who generously opened them for public use without charge.</p>
<p><i>Railroad library. </i>A library intended for the use of the employees of
  a railroad. Similar to a <i>Mill library.</i></p>
<p><i>Reading club library. </i>Members of reading clubs may have just exchanged
  the books they read. If there is evidence that they collected a library, it
  is included in this study and considered as a <i>Literary society library.</i></p>
<p><i>Reading room. </i>If there is evidence that library materials were available
  in a reading room, it has been included in this study. Sometimes the term <i>library
  and</i> <i>reading room </i>was used to distinguish a library from others for
  which no reading space was provided.</p>
<p><i>Reading room in a commercial enterprise. </i>In this study, reading rooms
  maintained by hotels, taverns, newspaper offices, and other businesses have
  been grouped together. Usually, library materials were available to customers
  at no extra cost.</p>
<p><i>Reform school library. </i>In this study, the library of a reform school
  is considered as a <i>Prison library.</i></p>
<p><i>Religious college society library. </i>This term is used in this study to
  include two kinds of libraries: 1) a library that had a religious emphasis and
  was owned by a society made up of students in a liberal arts college, and 2)
  any library owned by a society of students in a theological seminary. Apparently,
  all or almost all of these latter societies were religious in nature.</p>
<p><i>Religious historical society library. </i>A few denominations had historical
  societies, such as the Presbyterian Historical Society in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Philadelphia</st1:place></st1:City>.
  A library belonging to such a society has been considered as a <i>Religious
  society library.</i></p>
<p><i>Religious library belonging to a town. </i>A very few libraries, religious
  in content, were operated by towns as free public libraries during the eighteenth
  century and the early decades of the nineteenth century. These have been considered
  separately in this study.</p>
<p><i>Religious social library. </i>A library formed by a group of people who
  associated themselves together to acquire and use a religious library. See also
  <i>Church library.</i></p>
<p><i>Religious society library. </i>In this study, this term is used for any
  library established by a religious group other than the Young Men's Christian
  Association, a church, or a Sunday school if the group was not organized for
  the purpose of establishing a library. If the group was formed to establish
  a library, its library has been considered as a <i>Religious social library.</i></p>
<p><i>Saloon reading room. </i>Saloons sometimes maintained reading rooms as added
  attractions for their customers. In this study, such a room is included as a
  <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><i>Reading</i></st1:place></st1:City><i>
  room in a commercial enterprise.</i></p>
<p><i>School district library. </i>There were many school district libraries.
  Most of them were very small, and they are seldom listed separately in early
  national lists. Even though they were often used by adults, they are considered
  in this study as <i>School libraries</i>.</p>
<p> <i>School library. </i>This term is used in this study to mean a library belonging
  to an educational institution of less than college grade. There were many of
  these but they were often very small, and it has been impossible to obtain information
  about some of them. These are not included in the main part of the study.</p>
<p><i>Scientific or engineering college library. </i>In this study, libraries
  belonging to scientific or engineering colleges have been considered together
  because it has often been difficult to determine how much emphasis was placed
  on science and how much on engineering.</p>
<p><i>Scientific or engineering library owned by a government. </i>The federal
  government maintained several of these, mainly concerned with navigation. State
  and local governments had very few.</p>
<p><i>Secondary school library. </i>A library in a school containing the upper
  grades, below, college level. These are not included in the main part of the
  study.</p>
<p><i>Seminary library. </i>The term was used for two kinds of libraries before
  1876. Unless it was preceded by the term theological or a similar word, a seminary
  library belonged to a school of less than college grade and is not included
  in the main part of the study. <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">See</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on"><i>School</i></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><i>
  library. </i>If it was a <i>Theological seminary, </i>it is included. </p>
<p><i>Sewing circle library. </i>A few libraries, presumably operated by women,
  used this phrase in their names. In this study, such a library is considered
  as a <i>Ladies' society library.</i></p>
<p><i>Social historical library. </i>See <i>Historical social library.</i></p>
<p><i>Social law library. </i>A library operated by a society whose main purpose
  was to form a library of legal books. Different from a <i>Bar association library.</i></p>
<p><i>Social library. </i>This term has been used in various ways by different
  writers. In this study, if it used without modification, it means a library
  owned by an association formed to establish and operate a library intended for
  its members' use. Usually, the members subscribed for stock in order to purchase
  the initial collection, which was general in subject matter. Then they were
  assessed a smaller sum (a “tax”) each year to keep up the collection. If the
  members were drawn from a distinct part of the population or had a distinct
  subject interest, their library has been considered separately; for example,
  a <i>Ladies' social library, </i>or a <i>Social law library. </i>If the membership
  and collection were general in nature, and the maintenance of a library was

<p><i>Society library. </i>In this study, the term <i>society</i> and <i>association
  </i>are considered as having the same meaning. If a place name preceded the
  phrase <i>library society </i>it is considered as a <i>Social library. </i>When
  the word <i>society </i>occurs without a place name, it is considered as a library
  belonging to an association formed because of its members' subject interest,
  that is, an association that was not formed primarily to operate a library.
  For these associations, see the name for the kind of society, for example <i>Bar
  association library </i>or <i>Historical society library.</i> A few societies
  seem to have been general in interest; others had subject interest so specialized
  that a separate category for them did not seem worthwhile, and for some it has
  been impossible to determine the main subject interest. These general or miscellaneous
  societies have been considered as a singly group; examples are the library of
  the stage drivers of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Canandaigua</st1:City>,
  <st1:State w:st="on">New York</st1:State></st1:place>, the Tennessee Society
  for the Diffusion of Knowledge, and the Chess and Literary Association of Shasta,
  <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">California</st1:place></st1:State>.</p>
