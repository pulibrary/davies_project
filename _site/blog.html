                herald of 7 June 1866 (no page number) contains the report of the Board of Directors
                of the Library Association of St. Joseph. Formed 1 May 1865 as the Ladies Library
                Association, by 11 May it merged with the Mercantile Library Association under the
                above name. With two recent large additions, "the number of volumes now upon our
                shelves is about 1500. . . . Our catalogue comprises the best selection of standard
                works, embracing History, Biography, Poetry, Philosophy, Belle Lettres, Fiction,
                &amp;c." The librarian reported "our rooms have been constantly [in italics] visited
                by at least one hundred persons during the past year, and that the number of volumes
                read by each would average 25, making a total of 25,000 furnished by the Library. .
                . . The entire list of members during the past year comprised only one hundred and
                forty-nine persons." The library had "recently moved" to a "splendid and capacious
                Hall above the State Bank, on the corner of Fourth and Felix streets. . . .
                [H}ereafter it will be known as Library Hall." Lectures by John G Saxe and Bayard
                Taylor were sponsored by the library in 1865, "though the financial results were not
                the most satisfactory to us." Fundraising efforts (three "Festivals" and a
                "Concert") outside of membership fees totaled $1,069.45, and the "greater portion of
                these funds has been devoted to the purchase of books." The report is signed by L M
                Lawson, President; newly elected officers include C B Wilkinson, Pres; L M Lawson,
                VP; Mrs W Jones, 2nd VP; S S McGibbons, Treas; Rev R H Weller, Secre; and directors

                past time as well as passing events and believing that a good portion of our time

                be highly important in a republicon government where each one is Caled upon to
                perform his part in the government either in the discharge of his duties of his
                office or by his vote and for him to do it with Clearness of mind and soundness of
                judgment it is necessary for him to have some knowledge of the history of his Cuntry

                reign and we also believe that that the situation of our country our selves and our
                children call upon us for such an institution. Therefore we have united and hereby
                unite to form ourselves in a Society or body politic for the purpose of holding and
                preserving a library under the following rules." The volume also includes a record

                American Numismatic Society Library (ANS)was organized in 1858 by one of its
                founders, James D. Foskett, to foster academic scholarship in numismatics (coins,
                medals, and related objects). Foskett served as ANS Librarian between November 3,
                1858 to March 11, 1864. Other Librarians between 1850-1876 included: ANS founder,
                Edward Groh (1837-1925), from March 11, 1864 to February 9, 1865); Frank Leathe,
                from February 9, 1865 to March 22, 1866); Daniel Parish, Jr. (1842-1914), from March
                22, 1866 to March 25, 1869); and Dr. Isaac F. Wood (1841-1895), from March 25, 1869
                to March 16, 1880).</div>

                of Orange County, New York, vol. 1 (1881; rpt. 1980), 326: "By the act establishing
                the present system of free schools, the several school district libraries of the
                village were consolidated, and a single library established. The collection embraced
                some 2000 volumes, principally standard works. By subsequent purchases the number
                was increased to about 5000. In 1861 a union was effected with the Mechanics'
                Library Association, by which a material addition was secured, and in 1865, by an
                amendment to the free school law, the library thus formed became the Newburgh Free
                Library, with power in the Board of Education to provide for its maintenance by tax.
                During the year 1860 a very neat library building was erected, on Grand Street, by
                the Board of Education, and was occupied until its removal in 1874. The present
                commodious building was erected in 1876."</div>

                well-selected library with that of a debating society. . . . March 29, 1842, the
                association was incorporated, by an act of the Legislature, under the name of the
                'Newburgh Mechanics' Library Association,' for the 'purpose of establishing and
                maintaining a library, reading-room, literary and scientific lectures, and other
                means of promoting the moral, intellectual, and mechanical improvement' of its
                members." The account goes on to say that the library "was collected by the
                contribution of books, and by purchases made from the proceeds of several fairs."
                Upon acquiring the books of the Newburgh Library Association, q.v., on September 23,
                1847, the association had more than 3000 volumes. The library was "continued until
                1861, when public attention having been called to the subject in a series of
                articles in the News,it was, by unanimous concurrence of the members, united with

                West Chester until 1888, when it moved into a fine new building at 415 North Church
                Street. The land for the building was donated by Hannah Darlington; architect was T.
                Roney Williamson; and the builder was Edward Paxson. Funding for the library came
                from a number of sources, including, by 1900, a steady income from the Borough
                itself. The building was expanded once, in 1916, to add a children's room. Since
                then, the library has served as a community library as well as a school library for
                the West Chester School District through the 1960s.<br />The most recent development

                was open only to Fellows of the Academy for their use, but late in 1878 the Council
                (the governing body of the institution), at the request of Samuel Smith Purple, MD,

                the<br /> letters are responses to the society's offerings of<br /> honorary

                correspondence from these an other recognizable names<br /> is usually limited to
                one or two letters. A listing<br /> of correspondents for many of the letters
                concerning<br /> honorary membership is contained in the finding aid.<br /> Scope
                and content: Minutes (1825-1915 with gaps) include debate topics,<br /> participants
                and winners, fines for absenses and<br /> disorder, and proposed amendments.
                Constitution and<br /> by-laws (1828-1915) contains revisions of the<br />
                constitutionwith amendments for the majority of the<br /> society's existence.
                Membership Lists concentrate on<br /> honorary members from 1825-1866. The
                Addresses,<br /> 1828-1919 (bulk 1828-1883) include inaugural addresses<br /> given
                by the president of the society upon election. <br /> The inaugural addresses from
                the most comprehensive<br /> gathering of student essays in the collection,
                and,<br /> include the addresses of William Elliot Griffis and<br /> William H. S.
                Demarest. Commencement addresses, given<br /> by well known orators, sponsored and
                published by the<br /> society include those delivered by William Craig<br />
                Brownlee (1827), John Sergeant (1829), Theodore<br /> Freylinghuysen (1831), John D.
                Ogilby (1833), David<br /> Paul Brown (1835), Daniel D. Barnard (1837),

                (1851), Frederick T. Frelinghuysen<br /> (1853), Charles Murray Nairne (1857), and
                Theodore W.<br /> Dwight (1859). <br /> Scope and content: Committee records,
                strongest from 1827 through the<br /> 1860*s, are the best source for information on
                the<br /> internal politics of the society, as well as<br /> documenting relations
                with the Peithessophian Society,<br /> the faculty, and the administration.

                contain reports, account books, and loose receipts. <br /> The Librarian's records,
                1827-1889, reveal the<br /> literary inclinations of 19th-Century college<br />
                students. Catalogs for the years 1828, 1834, 1837,<br /> 1850, 1867, and 1875
                document the library's holdings. <br /> The book of borrowers (1827-1889) records
                the reading<br /> habits of individual students.<br />
