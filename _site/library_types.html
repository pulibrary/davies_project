<html>
<body>
<p>The type-of-library terms are taken, with some additions and changes, from American Libraries before 1876, by Haynes McMullen (Copyright Â© 2000 by Haynes McMullen).</p>

<p>Most are the terms are the ones actually used before 1876, although some are those employed by recent writers on American library history.  A couple of terms have no entries in the database but are listed here because they surely will one day.</p>

<p>Some researchers may be tempted to argue in certain cases for different terms.  There is, however, benefit to employing here the terms used by McMullen in his book, for standardization has benefits.  McMullen developed them to try to avoid ambiguity.  For example, 'circulating library' is itself an ambiguous term, applicable to almost all libraries, so McMullen employed 'commercial circulating library' to designate those operated as a business.</p>

<p>It may be, however, that some existing terms will be further subdivided, and some may be added.  Certainly, African American Library should be, and the scholarship on the topic should be searched to identify information on the institutions.  It may also be desirable to add terms for other types of institutions of reading, such as book clubs that did not form libraries but only circulated books among members.</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Academy Library.</dt>
            <dd> Almost always the library of a secondary school, so not included in the main part
                of this study unless it was a library of a military academy that gave college-level
                work. See the headings <i>School</i><i> library </i>and <i>Military academy
                    library.</i></dd>
            <dt>Agricultural and mechanical college library. </dt>
            <dd>The library of a college that emphasized agriculture and engineering. In this study,
                these colleges have been considered as agricultural colleges.</dd>
            <dt>Agricultural library belonging to a state government. </dt>
            <dd>A few state boards of agriculture had libraries, beginning in the 1850s.</dd>
            <dt>Agricultural social library.</dt>
            <dd> A library belonging to a group that was organized to establish a library about
                agriculture.</dd>
            <dt>Agricultural society library. </dt>
            <dd>A library owned by a society formed because its members were interested in
                agriculture. Some of these were called <i>Farmers' clubs</i>.</dd>
            <dt>Antiquarian library. </dt>
            <dd>In this study, such a library is considered as a <i>Historical society
                library.</i></dd>
            <dt>Apprentices' library. </dt>
            <dd>A library for the use of apprentices, usually planned and supervised by older
                businessmen or employees and usually containing a general collection of books. Often
                open to others besides apprentices. Similar to a <i>Mechanics library </i>or a
                    <i>Workingmen's library</i> but counted separately in this study. </dd>
            <dt>Art museum library. </dt>
            <dd>A small number of these existed, mainly after the Civil War. In this study, such a
                library has been considered as an <i>Art Society library.</i></dd>
            <dt>Art Society library. </dt>
            <dd>A library belonging to a society formed because of its members' interest in art. A
                very few of these existed, mainly after the Civil War. In this study, art museum
                libraries are included with them.</dd>
            <dt>Association library. </dt>
            <dd>See <i>Society library.</i></dd>
            <dt>Asylum library. </dt>
            <dd>The term <i>asylum </i>was widely used for any institution where handicapped or
                disadvantaged children or adults lived and were cared for. Many were maintained by
                charitable societies; others were operated by federal, state or local
                governments.</dd>
            <dt>Athenuem library </dt>
            <dd>(formerly spelled <i>athenaeum</i>). Athenuems were societies, partly social and
                partly cultural. Their libraries were like social libraries because both kinds were
                general and because the operation of a library was one of the main objects of the
                athenaeum. If the athenaeum library differed, it was because it might put more
                emphasis on current journals and newspapers.</dd>
            <dt>Bar association library. </dt>
            <dd>A library belonging to a group of lawyers whose association was not formed for the
                primary purpose of maintaining a library. See also <i>Social law library.</i></dd>
            <dt>Board of trade library. </dt>
            <dd>A library owned by an association of merchants whose main purpose was the regulation
                of trade or promotion of commerce. In this study, libraries of similar organizations
                known as <i>Merchants' exchanges</i> and <i>Chambers of commerce</i> are included
                with board of trade libraries.</dd>
            <dt>Book club library. </dt>
            <dd>Members of some book clubs exchanged the books they read. If there is evidence that
                they collected a library, it is included with <i>Literary society libraries</i> and
                    <i>Reading</i><i> club libraries</i>.</dd>
            <dt>Bray libraries. </dt>
            <dd>The libraries sent from England to Church of England parishes, mostly in Maryland
                beginning around 1700 through the efforts of Thomas Bray, have been considered in
                this study as <i>Church libraries.</i></dd>
            <dt>Business college library. </dt>
            <dd>Some schools for instruction of business skills owned libraries beginning in the
                1840s. These libraries have been included in the study although it is possible that
                their institutions did not offer work at the college level.</dd>
            <dt>Chamber of commerce library. </dt>
            <dd>A few such libraries existed; in this study, they are grouped with <i>Boards of
                    trade libraries</i> and <i>Merchants' exchanges libraries.</i></dd>
            <dt>Church library. </dt>
            <dd>A library maintained by a particular church in a particular town or city. In this
                study, the term is considered as separate from a <i>Sunday school library </i>and
                from any library owned by a group of churches or by some other religious
                association, which is considered as a <i>Religious society library.</i></dd>
            <dt>Circulating library. </dt>
            <dd>Originally, any library from which books could be taken home. The term was used to
                designate two main types: a <i>Commercial circulating library</i>, operated for
                profit, and a <i>Social library</i>, operated for the benefit of users. In recent
                years, historians have usually limited the term to mean what is called in this study
                a <i>Commercial circulating library.</i></dd>
            <dt>Club library. </dt>
            <dd>The term <i>club </i>began to be common in the 1850s to denote a society, usually
                with a social rather than a subject interest. In this study, a library belonging to
                such an organization has been considered as a <i>Society library.</i></dd>
            <dt>College library. </dt>
            <dd>A library belonging to an institution of higher education. In this study, the term
                    <i>college </i>alone means liberal arts college; a more specialized college is
                distinguished as <i>Medical college</i>,<i> Law school</i>, a<i> Theological
                    seminary</i>, or by any other appropriate phrase.<i> </i></dd>
            <dt>College literary society library. </dt>
            <dd>See <i>College</i><i> student society library.</i></dd>
            <dt>College student society library. </dt>
            <dd>A library belonging to a society of students in an institution of higher education.
                These societies, often called literary societies, held meetings for social and
                educational purposes and typically owned general collections of books. A few suck
                societies, mainly in theological seminaries, had libraries containing books on
                religion. Collections on other special subjects were rare.</dd>
            <dt>Commercial circulating library. </dt>
            <dd>A library owned by an individual or firm and containing books that were circulated
                to individuals for a fee. The fee was usually in the form of a subscription, payable
                monthly, quarterly or annually. The collections were almost always general and
                popular in nature.</dd>
            <dt>Commercial college library. </dt>
            <dd>See <i>Business college library.</i></dd>
            <dt>Convent library. </dt>
            <dd>A few convent libraries were discovered, apparently controlled by Roman Catholic
                organizations; they are counted as <i>Church libraries</i> in this study.</dd>
            <dt>County law library. </dt>
            <dd>This kind of library seems to have usually been the library owned by the county bar
                association. Therefore, in this study, such a library is considered as one belonging
                to a <i>Bar association</i> unless information indicates that it was not.<i> </i></dd>
            <dt>County library. </dt>
            <dd>This term had no generally accepted meaning, and was rare outside of Indiana, where
                a county library was a social library that has been established with funds from a
                special tax. In this study, it has been as a <i>Government-aided social
                library.</i></dd>
            <dt>Court library. </dt>
            <dd>Many local, state and federal courts had libraries. In this study, libraries
                belonging to each of these three forms of government are combined with other legal
                collections and are considered as <i>Law libraries.</i></dd>
            <dt>Dentistry library. </dt>
            <dd>A small number of dental libraries existed. In this study, they have been included
                with <i>Medical libraries.</i></dd>
            <dt>Education library. </dt>
            <dd>A few state governments operated libraries that were on the subject of education or
                were intended for educational professionals, beginning in the 1850s. The libraries
                operated by a few city boards of education at about the same time may have had an
                educational emphasis, but several of them were clearly general in content.</dd>
            <dt>Elementary school library. </dt>
            <dd>A library in a school containing only the lower grades. These libraries were not
                included in the main part of this study<b>.</b>

                <i>or engineering college library.</i></dd>
            <dt>Engineering society library. </dt>
            <dd>A small number of civil and mining engineers' societies had libraries, beginning in
                the 1850s. See <i>Scientific or engineering society library.</i></dd>

            <dt>Fire company library. </dt>
            <dd>A library owned by a volunteer fire company. These existed mainly in larger cities
                and were general in content.</dd>
            <dt>Foreign language library. </dt>
            <dd>A library collected by a group of people speaking a language other than English.
                Almost all of them were operated by German immigrant groups; see <i>German social
                    library</i>,<i> German society library</i>,<i> </i>and <i>Musical society
                    library.</i></dd>
            <dt>Fraternal organization library. </dt>
            <dd>A library belonging to a lodge of the Masons, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows,
                or other fraternal group. In this study, a library belonging to a German-speaking
                fraternal group is considered as a <i>German society library</i>, and the small
                number of Masonic college libraries is included with other <i>College
                libraries.</i></dd>
            <dt>Garrison library. </dt>

            <dt>German society library. </dt>
            <dd>A term used in this study to include any library belonging to a society of
                German-speaking people if the society was formed for some purpose other than the
                maintenance of a library. However, collections belonging to German singing societies
                have been grouped with those of other <i>Musical society libraries.</i></dd>

            <dt>Hospital library. </dt>
            <dd>A library in a hospital, whether intended for the patients or the medical staff. In
                this study, the patients' libraries are considered separately from the medical
                libraries because of the difference in subject matter. A library in a mental
                hospital is considered an <i>Asylum library.</i></dd>
            <dt>Hotel reading room. </dt>
            <dd>Hotels sometimes maintained reading rooms containing a few books, current journals,
                and newspapers. In this study, such a room is included as a <i>Reading</i><i> room

            <dd>A library in a home for unfortunate persons: unwed mothers, juvenile delinquents, or

                the main part of this study as a <i>Prison library</i>, but if it seemed to belong
                to another kind of school, it is not included in the main study. Only a few

            <dd>The word <i>institute </i>alone does not help to identify the type of library
                because some institutes were schools, some were societies, and some were charitable
                enterprises. The word seems to imply only that the agency was in some way
                educational, charitable or cultural.</dd>
            <dt>Juvenile society library. </dt>
            <dd>A library for children, organized by children or their elders. A few such libraries

            <dd>A library belonging to a society made up of persons interested in literature.
                However, because that term was often used broadly, the collection could have been

            <dd>A lyceum was an organization made up of people who met together to debate and to
                listen to lectures and who usually established a general library. If there is
                evidence that a lyceum had a library, it is included in this study. If a lyceum's
                main emphasis was its library, its purpose was almost the same as that of a

            <dd>A few libraries seem to have existed in institutions for the mentally ill, which
                were hospitals rather than asylums. However, the number was so small and the

            <dt>Mill library. </dt>
            <dd>A library maintained in a factory by its owner, for the use of employees. Sometimes

            <dt>Proprietary library. </dt>
            <dd>A term that was never in general use in the nineteenth century. It was used
                interchangeably with the term <i>Subscription library </i>by Edward Edwards in his
                book <i>Memoir of Libraries, </i>published in 1859. Apparently, the two terms were
                both used to describe social libraries until 1912 when Charles K. Bolton published a
                pamphlet, <i>Proprietary and Subscription Libraries,</i> and began to employ the
                term <i>Proprietary library </i>if the users of the collection owned stock in it; he
                employed the term <i>Subscription library</i> for one in which the users paid annual
                fees. Writers since his day have accepted his idea, apparently ignorant of the fact
                that, for many social libraries, the proprietors were called subscribers and paid an
                annual fee. They sometimes permitted others to use the collection for a fee. The
                term <i>Proprietary library </i>is not used in the present study.</dd>
            <dt>Public library. </dt>
            <dd>Before 1876, this term was ordinarily used to mean any library other than one owned
                by an individual for his or her own use. In that sense, it would include every
                library in the main part of this study. But in this study it is used in its more
                recent sense to mean a library, usually general in content, which was almost always
                owned by a local government and was open to most or all of the citizens without
                charge. No distinction is made as to means of financial support: whether by taxation
                or through the gifts of individuals. Also see <i>Religious library belonging to a
                    town.</i></dd>
            <dt>Public library owned by a religious group. </dt>
            <dd>A few libraries were owned by churched or religious societies and were clearly open
                to the public without charge. Because of the difficulty of determining the exact
                content and conditions of use of libraries owned by churched and other religious
                groups, each of these free libraries has been considered in this study as either a
                    <i>Church library</i> or a <i>Religious society library, </i>depending on its
                ownership. <i>Â </i></dd>
            <dt>Public library owned by an individual. </dt>
            <dd>A very few libraries owned by individuals who generously opened them for public use
                without charge.</dd>
            <dt>Railroad library. </dt>
            <dd>A library intended for the use of the employees of a railroad. Similar to a <i>Mill

            <dt>Reading club library. </dt>
            <dd>Members of reading clubs may have just exchanged the books they read. If there is
                evidence that they collected a library, it is included in this study and considered
                as a <i>Literary society library.</i></dd>
            <dt>Reading room. </dt>
            <dd>If there is evidence that library materials were available in a reading room, it has
                been included in this study. Sometimes the term <i>library and</i>
                <i>reading room </i>was used to distinguish a library from others for which no
                reading space was provided.</dd>
            <dt>Reading room in a commercial enterprise. </dt>
            <dd>In this study, reading rooms maintained by hotels, taverns, newspaper offices, and
                other businesses have been grouped together. Usually, library materials were
                available to customers at no extra cost.</dd>
            <dt>Reform school library. </dt>
            <dd>In this study, the library of a reform school is considered as a <i>Prison
                    library.</i></dd>
            <dt>Religious college society library. </dt>
            <dd>This term is used in this study to include two kinds of libraries: 1) a library that
                had a religious emphasis and was owned by a society made up of students in a liberal
                arts college, and 2) any library owned by a society of students in a theological
                seminary. Apparently, all or almost all of these latter societies were religious in
                nature.</dd>
            <dt>Religious historical society library. </dt>
            <dd>A few denominations had historical societies, such as the Presbyterian Historical
                Society in Philadelphia. A library belonging to such a society has been considered
                as a <i>Religious society library.</i></dd>
            <dt>Religious library belonging to a town. </dt>
            <dd>A very few libraries, religious in content, were operated by towns as free public
                libraries during the eighteenth century and the early decades of the nineteenth
                century. These have been considered separately in this study.</dd>
            <dt>Religious social library. </dt>
            <dd>A library formed by a group of people who associated themselves together to acquire
                and use a religious library. See also <i>Church library.</i></dd>
            <dt>Religious society library. </dt>
            <dd>In this study, this term is used for any library established by a religious group
                other than the Young Men's Christian Association, a church, or a Sunday school if
                the group was not organized for the purpose of establishing a library. If the group
                was formed to establish a library, its library has been considered as a <i>Religious
                    social library.</i></dd>
            <dt>Saloon reading room. </dt>
            <dd>Saloons sometimes maintained reading rooms as added attractions for their customers.
                In this study, such a room is included as a <i>Reading</i><i> room in a commercial
                    enterprise.</i></dd>
            <dt>School district library. </dt>
            <dd>There were many school district libraries. Most of them were very small, and they
                are seldom listed separately in early national lists. Even though they were often
                used by adults, they are considered in this study as <i>School libraries</i>.</dd>
            <dt>School library.</dt>
            <dd>This term is used in this study to mean a library belonging to an educational
                institution of less than college grade. There were many of these but they were often
                very small, and it has been impossible to obtain information about some of them.
                These are not included in the main part of the study.</dd>
            <dt>Scientific or engineering college library. </dt>
            <dd>In this study, libraries belonging to scientific or engineering colleges have been
                considered together because it has often been difficult to determine how much
                emphasis was placed on science and how much on engineering.</dd>
            <dt>Scientific or engineering library owned by a government. </dt>

            <dt>Secondary school library. </dt>
            <dd>A library in a school containing the upper grades, below, college level. These are
                not included in the main part of the study.</dd>
            <dt>Seminary library. </dt>
            <dd>The term was used for two kinds of libraries before 1876. Unless it was preceded by
                the term theological or a similar word, a seminary library belonged to a school of
                less than college grade and is not included in the main part of the study. See
                    <i>School</i><i> library. </i>If it was a <i>Theological seminary, </i>it is
                included. </dd>
            <dt>Sewing circle library. </dt>
            <dd>A few libraries, presumably operated by women, used this phrase in their names. In
                this study, such a library is considered as a <i>Ladies' society library.</i></dd>
            <dt>Social historical library. </dt>
            <dd>See <i>Historical social library.</i></dd>
            <dt>Social law library. </dt>
            <dd>A library operated by a society whose main purpose was to form a library of legal
                books. Different from a <i>Bar association library.</i></dd>
            <dt>Social library. </dt>
            <dd>This term has been used in various ways by different writers. In this study, if it
                used without modification, it means a library owned by an association formed to
                establish and operate a library intended for its members' use. Usually, the members
                subscribed for stock in order to purchase the initial collection, which was general
                in subject matter. Then they were assessed a smaller sum (a âtaxâ) each year to keep
                up the collection. If the members were drawn from a distinct part of the population
                or had a distinct subject interest, their library has been considered separately;
                for example, a <i>Ladies' social library, </i>or a <i>Social law library. </i>If the
                membership and collection were general in nature, and the maintenance of a library
                was one of several purposes of a group, it has been considered as a <i>Society
                    library.</i></dd>

            <dd>See <i>Religious social library.</i></dd>
            <dt>Society library. </dt>
            <dd>In this study, the term <i>society</i> and <i>association </i>are considered as
                having the same meaning. If a place name preceded the phrase <i>library society
                </i>it is considered as a <i>Social library. </i>When the word <i>society </i>occurs
                without a place name, it is considered as a library belonging to an association
                formed because of its members' subject interest, that is, an association that was
                not formed primarily to operate a library. For these associations, see the name for
                the kind of society, for example <i>Bar association library </i>or <i>Historical
                    society library.</i> A few societies seem to have been general in interest;
                others had subject interest so specialized that a separate category for them did not
                seem worthwhile, and for some it has been impossible to determine the main subject
                interest. These general or miscellaneous societies have been considered as a singly
                group; examples are the library of the stage drivers of Canandaigua, New York, the
                Tennessee Society for the Diffusion of Knowledge, and the Chess and Literary
                Association of Shasta, California.</dd>

            <dd>A collection of law books belonging to a state court of other state agency. In this
                study such a library is considered as different from a <i>State library, </i>which
                typically contained law books and general subject matter.</dd>
            <dt>State library. </dt>
            <dd>The term was used before 1876 to mean the library maintained the state government at
                the capital of the state, intended for the use of state officials. Typically, the
                library was divided into two main parts: one for law books and one for general
                books.</dd>
            <dt>Strict social library. </dt>
            <dd>A term used in this study for a <i>Social library </i>organized and used by a
                society made up people whose main purpose was to gather and read a general or
                miscellaneous collection of books.</dd>
            <dt>Subscription library. </dt>
            <dd>This term has been used by some modern writers to mean a <i>Social library </i>in
                which the users did not own the collection, but paid an annual fee, in contrast to a
                    <i>Proprietary library</i>, which was owned by the users. Actually, in a typical
                library, the proprietors paid annual fees. Sometimes, they permitted others to use
                the library for a fee. The term <i>Subscription library </i>is not used in this
                study. See <i>Proprietary library.</i></dd>
            <dt>Sunday school library. </dt>
            <dd>An American Sunday school, in the early part of the nineteenth century, was
                sometimes operated by an individual church and sometimes cooperatively by several
                churches, mainly to teach religion. Very many existed; usually their libraries were
                small. They are not included in the main part of the study.</dd>
            <dt>Supreme court library. </dt>
            <dd>In this study, the library of the United States Supreme Court is included with other
                federal law libraries and the libraries of state supreme counts are included with
                other law libraries belonging to the states.</dd>
            <dt>Tavern reading room. </dt>
            <dd>Some taverns maintained reading rooms, with a few books, current journals and
                newspapers. In this study, such as a room is included as a <i>Reading</i><i> room in
                    a commercial enterprise.</i></dd>
            <dt>Temperance library. </dt>
            <dd>In this study, a temperance library is considered as a religious library<i>. </i>If
                it was operated by a church, it is considered as a <i>Church library</i>; and if by
                some other group, as a <i>Religious society library.</i></dd>
            <dt>Territorial library. </dt>
            <dd>Several of the territories had libraries at the seats of government. Because such a
                library became a state library when the territory achieved statehood, no distinction
                has been made here, and it is considered as a <i>State library </i>even while it
                served the territorial government.</dd>

            <dd>In this study, any library belonging to a society of students in a theological
                seminary is considered as a <i>Religious college society library.</i>
            </dd>
            <dt>Township library. </dt>
            <dd>A public library for a township, which is a division of a county in the Middle West.
                Most of these libraries were established by state governments in Michigan and
                Indiana, beginning in the 1940s/ Sometimes that have been considered as <i>School
                    libraries</i>, but they were intended for adults as well.</dd>
            <dt>United States Government library. </dt>
            <dd>Some federal libraries were general or miscellaneous, as for example the Library of
                Congress and the library in the Executive Mansion. A few were on engineering or
                scientific subjects, and a few others consisted mainly of law books. The total
                number of federal libraries was not large.</dd>
            <dt>University library. </dt>
            <dd>There were several university libraries before 1876, but the university, in the
                present sense of the ward was so rare that each of them has been considered as a

            <dd>A library for the use of laborers. Most of these collections were in Indiana and
                most were established with the aid of funds left in the will of William Maclure.

            <dd>A library established by young men who belonged to an organization that had been
                formed for some purpose other than the maintenance of a library. In this study,
                collections belonging to Young Men's Christian Associations are considered
